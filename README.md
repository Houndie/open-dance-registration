# Open Dance Registration

There are a lot of registration options out there.  This will eventually be another!

## Purpose
Our goal is to provide a free, open-source, and easy-to-deploy system which allows Swing Dance event organizers to host their own registration systems, without being forced to pay for SASS solutions.

## What are we not?
We are not targeting other non-swing dance events (although you're free to use the software to do so if it meets your needs!)

We are not at this time targeting to become our own SASS solution, although we may in the future.  The primary goal is adding features to make the software applicable to as many dance events as possible.  Once/if development on these features starts to slow down, features supporting SASS may be considered.  If you are looking for a SASS solution at this time, try one of these other softwares, which at this time may have more features and are already deployed for you.

## Deployment/Useability Docs

This software is still under development and not yet ready for prime time.  Once we reach a mimimum viable set of features to hold your own dance registration, we'll work on documentation as to how to use this product for yourself.

## FAQ

### Why another event registration service, when there are already so many!

Many dance organizers, myself included, run events on a shoestring budget.  Many dance events are nonprofit.  To myself and other organizers in this situation, the thought of giving subscriptions or percentages to a SASS service is a cost that can be tough to swallow.  In many ways, this provides an alternative to that situation.  And, while there are a few open source event mangement systems out there, I haven't yet found one that meets my needs as a dance event organizer.

### Why Rust?

I will be the first to admit that while Rust is good at both web and backend server development, it's not the best tool out there for either task.  That said, there are two reasons I chose rust for this project:

* While not the best at either task, it's reasonably good at both, which allows for the possibility of shared code libraries between the web and server environment.
* I really like Rust and at the end of the day this is my hobby project, and I'm going to code it in the way I find most fun.
